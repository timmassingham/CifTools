cifjoin(1)
===========

NAME
----
cifjoin - Join several CIF files from an Illumina machine together

SYNOPSIS
--------

*cifjoin*   [-l lane] [-t tile] run-folder

*cifjoin*   --help

*cifjoin*   --licence

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Within a run folder, the intensity data for each cycle is stored in
a separate CIF file so each file contains one cycle of one tile of one
lane. Given a lane, tile and run folder, cifjoin merges the
appropriate CIF files into a single CIF file containing all cycles
which is appropriate for use with base calling software. The resulting
CIF file is written to stdout.

*-l, --lane* [default: 4]::
Lane of tile to create full CIF file.

*-t, --tile* [default: 33]::
Tile number to create full CIF file of.

*-h, --help*::
Display information about usage and exit.

*--licence*::
Display licence terms and exit.
